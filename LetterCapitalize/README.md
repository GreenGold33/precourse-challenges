Letter capitalize
==============

You can try this problem online with [coderbyte's editor](https://coderbyte.com/editor/guest:Letter%20Changes:JavaScript)

Using the JavaScript language, have the function `LetterCapitalize(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space. 

Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.

If you have node installed type the command `node LetterCapitalize` in your terminal.
